# What else?

... is not ready yet ðŸ˜¢

This page will work as a collection of (hopefully _cool_ ) pages either on this site or elsewhere on the internet.

#### Why this page?

I didn't want to implement a complicated, Javascript-dependent navigation bar. Maybe it can be done, however I thought that a separate page could work really well - both for navigation on this site, as well as outside of it.
