  <h2>What I do üõ†Ô∏è</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy running (and sometimes
    <a title="My Codeberg (git) profile" href="https://codeberg.org/fourstepper"
      >building</a
    >) great software, making sure it's stable and observable. If the software
    isn't great, isn't stable or isn't observable, I enjoy changing it to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    No matter the project, I focus on building simple and reliable
    infrastructure that serves it's purpose and it's users to the maximum,
    <strong>on scales from one to millions of users</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some technologies I am currently excited about include the
    <a title="Grafana website" href="https://grafana.com">Grafana LGTM stack</a
    >,
    <a title="Golang website" href="https://go.dev">Golang</a>,

    <a title="OpenTofu website" href="https://opentf.org/">OpenTofu</a> as well.

    I currently work as an Infrastructure Engineer at <a
      href="https://heureka.group/cz-en">Heureka Group</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h2>How I relax üèÉ üìñ üíª</h2>
  <p>
    I have been getting back into excercising. I enjoy running / swimming in the
    morning and longer walks in the evening. I also recreationally <span
      class="lower">(read: occassionally)</span
    > climb, hike, dive and play tennis.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would like to, eventually, run a 100K ultra-marathon.
    <s>
      I am specifically eyeing the easier, Czech <a
        title="Barokomaraton website"
        href="http://barokomaraton.cz/en/en/">Barokomaraton 100K</a
      >
      to start off with and the
      <a href="https://valdaran.utmb.world/">Val d'Aran 100K / 100 miler</a>
      later on, as I progress.
    </s>
    For 2024, I've registered for the beautiful
    <a href="https://mozart.utmb.world/races/mozart100">mozart 100</a> race in Austria.
    Super excited already!
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than that, similarly to most others, I like to spend time with my
    loved ones, read books, watch TV shows, eat good food and drink great
    coffee. Nothing extraordinary. ü´†
