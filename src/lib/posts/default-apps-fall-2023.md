Joining in on the list, here are my default apps at the end of 2023.

<!--more-->

[Similarly](https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023) to [many](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-11-07-app-defaults) [others](https://defaults.rknight.me/), I've chosen to share my list of default apps for essentially two reasons:

1. It's low effort material that I can post, during time of the year which I am not the most productive in
2. I will hopefully be able to look at this list later on and think about _the good old days™_

Robb Knight (whom I haven't heard about until today) apparently also maintains a [list of people that have joined in on this](https://defaults.rknight.me/). The instant I post this post, I will [add myself to the list](https://github.com/rknightuk/app-defaults/edit/main/_data/sites.json) as well.
